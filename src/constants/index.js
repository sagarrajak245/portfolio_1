export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer with expertise in building scalable webapps. I also explore Machine Learning and AI agents to craft intelligent, data-driven solutions. I thrive on turning ideas into impactful digital experiences`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = ` Hi, I'm Sagar Rajak, a third-year B.E. student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at VESIT, Mumbai with Current Cgpa of 9.2 . I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer and AI enthusiast with a strong foundation in MERN stack, Flutter, and modern database systems like MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

Beyond full-stack development, I have hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, and LLM-powered applications. I've built intelligent systems using CrewAI, LangChain, and Flask-based LLM backends to automate workflows like research, writing, and social media post generation.

I've conducted ML workshops, mentored peers, and delivered practical projects‚Äîfrom classifying Spotify hits with logistic regression to building GDP predictors using clustering and regression models. I actively explore how AI agents and LLMs can solve real-world challenges and enhance productivity.

I'm always excited to take on new challenges, collaborate with forward-thinking teams, and contribute to innovative tech solutions that make an impact.`;
