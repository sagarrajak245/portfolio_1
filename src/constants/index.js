export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer with expertise in building scalable webapps. I also explore Machine Learning and AI agents to craft intelligent, data-driven solutions. I thrive on turning ideas into impactful digital experiences`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = ` Hi, I'm Sagar Rajak, a third-year B.E. student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at VESIT, Mumbai. I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer and AI enthusiast with a strong foundation in MERN stack, Flutter, and modern database systems like MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

Beyond full-stack development, I have hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, and LLM-powered applications. I've built intelligent systems using CrewAI, LangChain, and Flask-based LLM backends to automate workflows like research, writing, and social media post generation.

I've conducted ML workshops, mentored peers, and delivered practical projectsâ€”from classifying Spotify hits with logistic regression to building GDP predictors using clustering and regression models. I actively explore how AI agents and LLMs can solve real-world challenges and enhance productivity.

I'm always excited to take on new challenges, collaborate with forward-thinking teams, and contribute to innovative tech solutions that make an impact.`;
